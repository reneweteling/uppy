## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Rust + Tauri
- **Cloud Storage**: Amazon S3
- **Build Tools**: Vite + pnpm
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions with semantic release

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager
- AWS S3 bucket and credentials

### Recommended Development Tools

For the best development experience, we recommend:

- **[asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/)** - Universal version manager for Node.js and Rust
- **[direnv](https://direnv.net/)** - Automatic environment variable management

**Quick setup:**

```bash
asdf install    # Install required versions
direnv allow    # Allow environment variables
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/reneweteling/uppy.git
   cd uppy
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.envrc` file in the project root:

   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
   export AWS_REGION="eu-west-1"
   export AWS_BUCKET="your-bucket-name"
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and run**
   ```bash
   asdf install    # Install required versions
   direnv allow    # Allow environment variables
   pnpm install    # Install dependencies
   pnpm tauri dev  # Start development
   ```

## 📦 Building for Production

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

### Generate icons

```bash
pnpm generate-icons
```

The built applications will be available in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`:

- **macOS**: `.dmg` package
- **Windows**: `.msi` installer
- **Linux**: `.deb` package

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable                | Description    | Default             |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     | AWS access key | Required            |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS secret key | Required            |
| `AWS_REGION`            | AWS region     | `eu-west-1`         |
| `AWS_BUCKET`            | S3 bucket name | `uppy.weteling.com` |

### Tauri Configuration

The app window can be customized in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`:

```json
{
  "app": {
    "windows": [
      {
        "title": "uppy",
        "width": 800,
        "height": 600,
        "dragDropEnabled": false
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Upload Process

1. **File Selection**: Drag & drop or click to select files
2. **Upload Strategy**:
   - Files ≤5MB: Direct upload via presigned POST
   - Files >5MB: Multipart upload with 5MB chunks
3. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress with speed/time estimates
4. **Completion**: Files are made publicly accessible and URLs are generated

### File Management

- **View**: Browse all uploaded files with metadata
- **Rename**: Double-click any file name to rename
- **Download**: Click download to open file in browser
- **Share**: Copy file URL to clipboard
- **Delete**: Remove files with confirmation dialog

## 🔒 Security

- Uses AWS IAM credentials for secure S3 access
- Presigned URLs with 1-hour expiration
- Files are automatically set to public read ACL
- No file content is stored locally (only metadata)

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Development Guidelines

- Use conventional commits for commit messages
- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed

## 📝 Scripts

| Command               | Description                   |
